# JavaCoursePractices

Welcome to **JavaCoursePractices**! This repository contains various Java exercises and examples 
I have worked on, ranging from the basics to more advanced topics. 
It's a personal project where I practice and improve my Java skills from scratch. 
As I continue learning and adding new content, this repository will grow with more exercises and topics.

## About

This repository contains Java exercises that I have completed, starting from the basics and gradually covering more advanced topics.
The exercises are designed to help me practice core Java concepts such as:

- Variables, data types, and user input
- Control statements and loops
- Arrays and collections
- Methods, classes, and object-oriented programming
- Math operations, random numbers, and other built-in Java utilities

The content is organized into folders based on topics, and I will continue adding more exercises and explanations as I progress.

## Course Structure

The repository is organized into different folders, each containing exercises on specific topics. 
Below is an overview of the folder structure:

### Topics Covered

- **basicsOfJava**: This folder contains exercises related to Java fundamentals such as variables, user input, GUI, random numbers, spy numbers, floating-point numbers, swapping values, factorials, math methods, and expressions.
- **controlStatements**: Covers `if`, `else`, `switch`, and conditional statements.
- **loopsInJava**: Exercises that involve various loops such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.
- **array**: Includes exercises on arrays, multi-dimensional arrays, and array manipulation.
- **wrapperClass**: Examples demonstrating the use of wrapper classes in Java.
- **methodsInJava**: Exercises focused on creating and using methods in Java.
- **classWithMethods**: This folder contains exercises that combine classes and methods to create functional Java programs.

## Exercises

Each folder contains specific exercises that I have worked on. Some examples include:

- **Variables**: Simple Java programs that work with primitive data types like `int`, `double`, `char`, etc.
- **User Input**: Programs that take input from the user via the console.
- **GUI**: Creating basic graphical user interfaces using Java.
- **Math Methods**: Exploring Java's built-in math methods, like `Math.random()`, `Math.pow()`, etc.
- **Swapping Values**: Exercises demonstrating how to swap values of variables using different methods.
- **Factorial**: A program that calculates the factorial of a number using iteration or recursion.

> **Note**: This repository is **not yet complete**. More exercises and content will be added over time as
>  I continue my learning journey.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository, you'll need Java installed on your computer.
Follow these steps to set up your local development environment:

1. **Install Java**: If you haven't installed Java yet, download and install the latest version of the [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Hailemeskel-Getaneh/JavaCoursePractices.git
   ```

3. **Open the Repository in Your IDE**: You can use any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code with Java extensions) to open and run the exercises.

4. **Run Exercises**: Navigate to the folder for a particular exercise, open the Java file, and run it to see the output.

## Progress

This repository is a work in progress, and I’m actively adding more content and exercises. Here is the current progress:

- **Completed Topics**: Basics of Java, control statements, loops, arrays, methods, and wrapper classes.
- **In-Progress**: More advanced Java concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), GUI development, and others will be added soon.

> **Next Steps**: Future topics will include advanced concepts like exception handling, file I/O, multithreading, and Java libraries.

## Contributing
